# Data-Set Visualization
This section is intended for you to provide helpful visualizations for the features as a whole, such 
as the correlation matrix, as well as providing visualizations for pairs of features such as plot and 
the line plot, also and providing plots such as bar plot, pie chart.

- Overall Feature Insights:
● Correlation Matrix: Visualize the pairwise relationships between all features using a 
correlation matrix. This helps identify potential correlations, redundancy, and outliers.

- Feature-Pair Analysis:
● Scatterplots (Dot Plot): Explore relationships between any specific pairs of features 
using scatterplots. This helps identify trends, outliers, and potential non-linear 
relationships.
● Line Plots: Analyze the relationship between features over time using line plots. This 
is useful for time-series data.

- Individual Feature Analysis:
● Distribution Plots: Visualize the distribution of each feature using histograms. This 
reveals skewness and Specify the Skewedness if it is applicable.
● Bar Plots and Pie Charts: For the features, use bar plots and pie charts to represent the 
frequencies or proportions of different categories.

- Additional Plots:
● Boxplots: Compare the distributions of features across different groups or categories.
● Probability Plots: Check if the data follows a specific theoretical distribution.
● Heatmaps: Explore relationships between multiple features simultaneously.

# Data-Set Statistics

- Descriptive Statistics (For Each Column):
● Central Tendency: Mean, Median, Mode
● Dispersion: Standard Deviation, Variance
● Quantiles: Percentiles (e.g., 25th, 50th, 75th)
● Minimum and Maximum Values
